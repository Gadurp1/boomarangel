# BOOMERANGELIC: A Roguelike Where You're The Weapon

## Core Concept
You're a sentient boomerang trying to find the perfect wielder in a dungeon full of incompetent adventurers. Instead of upgrading yourself, you upgrade your humans.

## Gameplay Loop
- Enter room
- Possess random adventurer
- Clear room using their unique throwing style
- Rate their performance
- Choose to keep or find new wielder
- Upgrade surviving wielders between runs

## Wielder Types
- The Panicked Rookie
  - Throws you randomly
  - Screams a lot
  - Sometimes throws themselves instead
  - High dodge (due to constant flailing)

- The Overconfident Barbarian
  - Maximum power, minimum aim
  - Sometimes throws other enemies
  - Occasionally catches you with face
  - Special: Rage throw (eyes closed)

- The "Physics Expert"
  - Calculates throws with complex math
  - Takes too long to aim
  - Mutters quantum mechanics
  - Special: Analysis paralysis

- The Retired Juggler
  - Fast but erratic throws
  - Tries to do tricks mid-combat
  - Randomly starts juggling enemies
  - Special: Performance mode

## Absurd Upgrades
### For Wielders
- Extra Arms (More throws, more problems)
- Rocket Boots (Mobile but unstable)
- Enhanced Vision (Can see through walls, often walks into them)
- Time Perception (Slower time, slower brain)
- Rubber Bones (Can't break, but very bouncy)

### For Rooms
- Anti-Gravity Zones
- Mirrored Reality
- Time Hiccups
- Floor is Actually Ceiling
- Walls Made of Jelly

## Progression System
- Wielder Experience
  - Gain "Throw Confidence"
  - Unlock signature moves
  - Develop weird quirks
  - Learn wrong lessons

- Meta Currency: "Throw Cred"
  - Unlock new wielder types
  - Buy training equipment
  - Upgrade training facility
  - Install safety nets (that nobody uses)

## Room Types
- The Dojo (Tutorial gone wrong)
- The Physics Puzzle (That nobody understands)
- The Time Trial (With broken clock)
- The Boss Room (Boss is on lunch break)
- The Shop (Shopkeeper throws you out, literally)

## Unique Mechanics
- Wielder Stress System
  - Too calm: Falls asleep
  - Too stressed: Throws everything
  - Perfect stress: Still terrible, but funny

- Throw Rating System
  - "Task Failed Successfully"
  - "Technically Correct"
  - "Physics Left The Chat"
  - "Task Successfully Failed"

- Death System
  - Wielders don't die, they "tactically retreat"
  - Or get launched into another dimension
  - Or become part of the wall decoration
  - You can't die (you're a boomerang)

## Visual Style
- Exaggerated animations
- Physics-defying trajectories
- Panic indicators
- Thought bubbles with wrong calculations
- Trail of destruction
- Wielder confidence meter (always wrong)

## Sound Design
- Doppler effect on screams
- Panic breathing
- Mathematical mumbling
- Victory fanfare (plays at wrong times)
- "Educational" physics facts

## Technical Implementation
- Heavy use of Godot's physics system
- Procedural room generation
- State machine for wielder behavior
- Particle effects for chaos visualization
- Replay system for especially bad throws

## Why It Works
1. Constant Entertainment
   - Every throw is potentially chaos
   - Wielders provide constant comedy
   - Failure is more fun than success

2. Roguelike Elements
   - Each run is unique
   - Permanent progression
   - Random combinations
   - Multiple strategies (all wrong)

3. Scope Control
   - Core mechanic is simple
   - Content is modular
   - Easy to add new wielders
   - Bugs become features

4. Marketability
   - Highly clippable moments
   - Streamable chaos
   - Natural humor
   - "Did you see what my wielder just did?" 

### Throwing Styles & Wielder Techniques

## The Panicked Rookie's Throws
1. The Flail-and-Pray
   - Random trajectory changes
   - Unpredictable bounces
   - Sometimes hits targets by accident
   - Bonus damage from sheer luck

2. The Backwards Toss
   - Throws in wrong direction
   - You correct mid-flight
   - Enemies confused by trajectory
   - Can hit rear weak points

## The Overconfident Barbarian's Throws
1. The MAXIMUM POWER
   - Straight line, maximum speed
   - Breaks through weak walls
   - Often overshoots target
   - Creates sonic boom effects

2. The Spin-to-Win
   - Spins in circles before throwing
   - Creates spiral pattern
   - Gets dizzy afterward
   - Area denial attack

## The "Physics Expert's" Throws
1. The Calculated Arc
   - Takes forever to aim
   - Shows trajectory prediction
   - Mutters complex equations
   - Actually pretty accurate

2. The Quantum Uncertainty
   - Multiple phantom trajectories
   - Exists in several paths at once
   - Confuses everyone including self
   - May hit parallel dimensions

## The Retired Juggler's Throws
1. The Show-off Special
   - Unnecessary flips and spins
   - Crowd appears to applaud
   - Style points multiply damage
   - May start juggling enemies

2. The Triple Ricochet
   - Bounces off multiple surfaces
   - Each bounce adds flair
   - Increasingly complex patterns
   - Final hit does jazz hands

## Special Techniques

### The Panic Master
- Ultimate: The Total Meltdown
  - Throws everything including self
  - Room becomes chaos
  - Random critical hits
  - Achievement: "Task Failed Successfully"

### The Barbarian Champion
- Ultimate: MAXIMUM MAXIMUM POWER
  - Throws so hard they launch backward
  - Creates shockwave
  - Breaks physics engine
  - Achievement: "Too Strong to Fail"

### The Physics PhD
- Ultimate: The Grand Unified Theory
  - Covers room in floating equations
  - Reality breaks briefly
  - Enemies question existence
  - Achievement: "Actually Rocket Science"

### The Performance Artist
- Ultimate: The Grand Finale
  - Creates circus environment
  - Impossible trick shots
  - Spontaneous fireworks
  - Achievement: "Standing Ovation"

## Throwing Modifications
- Wielder stress affects trajectory
- Environmental factors change paths
- Confidence meter modifies accuracy
- Each throw can be "improved" by wielder's quirks

## Training System
- Wielders learn wrong lessons
- Skills evolve in unexpected ways
- New techniques discovered by accident
- "Improvements" make throws more chaotic

## Why This Works
1. Emergent Gameplay
   - Each style creates unique situations
   - Combinations create chaos
   - Failure is entertaining
   - Success is spectacular

2. Skill Expression
   - Master the chaos
   - Learn to predict unpredictability
   - Use wielder quirks strategically
   - Turn weaknesses into strengths

3. Entertainment Value
   - Every throw tells a story
   - Memorable moments
   - Streaming-friendly
   - "Did you see what my wielder just did?"
